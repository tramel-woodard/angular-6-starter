# angular-6-starter
Complete Angular 6 Starter utilizing Angular 6.0.2.

## Angular 6 Starter Issues
### @angular/cli Upgrade
Before creating an Angular 6 application, you will want to ensure that your @angular/cli version is at least 1.7.4.

### 'ng new' Error Path '/app/app.module.ts' does not exist
If you upgrade Angular and come across the following error:

`Error: Path "/app/app.module.ts" does not exist.`
`Path "/app/app.module.ts" does not exist.`

Your previous version of Angular may be too old to completely update as needed. If this is the case, you will need to uninstall Node.js, reinstall from the website and as above, ensure, your @angular/cli version is 1.7.4 or above.

### Installing Angular 5.x.x Application Before Upgrading to Angular 6
Until the @angular/cli 'ng new' command is updated to create a standard package.json file that contains Angular 6, this starter package is created with a Angular 5.x.x and then updated to Angular 6.x.x using the 'ng upgrade' command from @angular/cli 1.7.4:

### Upgrading from Angular 5.x.x to 6.x.x
In order to upgrade from 5.x.x to 6.x.x, I changed into the angular-6-starter directory and performed the following updates:


### 'ng serve' Issue
For some installations, after running 'ng new', the following error occurs:
`Local workspace file ('angular.json') could not be found.`
`Error: Local workspace file ('angular.json') could not be found.`

In order to upgrade your local version (inside the application directory), the following had to be executed:

`ng update @angular/cli`

This command will update your application from 5.x.x to the latest version of 6.x.x.
